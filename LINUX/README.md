# Linux Practice â€“ Command History Logs

This folder contains screenshots of Linux command-line history, organized by **day** and **sequence**, for the purpose of academic submission and self-practice documentation.

Each image corresponds to a terminal session where I executed various Linux commands related to shell usage, package management, file handling, and system utilities.
